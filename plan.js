NOTE: The server side code hasn't been modularized properly, go through the dependencies and code of John to modularize it after you are done making an initial prototype.

NOTE: Some of the REST convention aren't followed in our code. There is a scope to implement pagination, offset and all those things described in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mN3VyJuCjM&ab_channel=ByteByteGo), once you are done with an initial prototype, make your code follow the REST norms.


To do in the frontend:
-> Google Map API (Implement it using ejs, if the api respond to the request, display the map otherwise do not.)
-> https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1908 --> This design for the pricing card.
-> Remove coworking subscription.
-> Slider functionality setup 
-> Get in touch section--> icons setup and design tweaks.
-> FAQ tweaks for smooth drop down.
-> Navbar setup (connection of different pages or scroll down effect to different sections.)
-> Hero section slider effect.



Backend:
-> Sign up. -> Email authentication.
-> JWT for login. --> Frontend for the user. --> Regular expression is one of the option for doing authentication.
-> Admin panel. --> Showing up the database. --> Authentication of admin and giving him the database to show everything. --> Admin should have a control on the database.
