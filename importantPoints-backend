1. There are two ways of sending data from the frontend, the first one to send data as JSON,
and this method is very common when we are developing a software in javascript.
The second method is using URLENCODED format, which is what we prefer when we use PHP.

2. If we use JS, we will mostly use URLENCODED.


3. Always encrypt the passwords before storing them into the database. There are many algorithms 
for hashing password. Some of them are bcrypt, md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, etc.

4. Some characteristics of a good hashing algorithm:
    -> Algorithm should be slow. This will help against a hacker who would try to brute force it.
    -> The collision which means same key generating for two different characters or character array
    should be minimal or improbable.

5. You client has to authenticate to the server who it is. There are two ways of doing this:
    a> Client somehow prove itself through a non-changeable secret data. (JSON Web Token)
    b> Client and Server shares a secret. (Cookie)


6. EJS path specification for CSS and JS files is quite weird. Look into it.

7. The data that you will send from the backend to the frontend should be first converted to the JSON format then you will do the binding of it to the frontend.

8. The project is not component based, so use display: none to hide something while performing CRUD operation.
