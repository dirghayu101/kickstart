1. There are two ways of sending data from the frontend, the first one to send data as JSON,
and this method is very common when we are developing a software in javascript.

4. Some characteristics of a good hashing algorithm:
    -> Algorithm should be slow. This will help against a hacker who would try to brute force it.
    -> The collision which means same key generating for two different characters or character array
    should be minimal or improbable.
