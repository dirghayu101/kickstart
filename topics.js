/*
1-> What is node.js and why we used node.js for our backend despite of multiple options available? Kartikaa

2-> How express.js simplifies node.js? Client side rendering and fetch method in javascript. Kartikaa

3-> What were the advantages of relational database over non-relational database specific to our project that made us choose a relational database? Anushree

4-> What is PSQL and why we chose it over SQL or other relational databases? Kartikaa

5-> EJS use in our project, how it helped us with making dynamic pages in our project? Ramisha

6-> Explanation for app.use(express.static('<path>')) Anushree

7-> Use of body-parser in project and localStorage in the client side. Ramisha

8-> How does postgres package works in our project and simplifies the connection with the DBMS? Ramisha

9-> Encryption and its importance. Use of bcrypt package in our project to encrypt password. Anushree

10-> Use of JSON Web Token in our project and its working process by embedding it in the header of our get requests. (Kartikaa)

11-> Testing in our project. Cover our testing strategies (make those up). And how we resolved different issues that arose on our way. (This topic is big) -> (Anushree) 

12-> Modularization of our backend. Division of the codebase into controllers, middleware and routers. How it makes the code easier to understand? (Ramisha)

13-> Error handling in the backend. (Ramisha)

14-> Planning and entire things we did. (Makeup something) -> (Kartikaa)

NOTE:

1. Your writeup should answer the question and font should be arial with size 12 as mentioned in the official document. (Try to resist the temptation to increase line spacing as they have officially mentioned 1.5mm)

2. Use paraphrasing tools as you did for the term paper.

3. Note down all the references, we will include them to increase the page count.

4. Try to write a minimum of 3 pages (80-100 should be the total pages). Even though no one will stop you from writing more. 

For testing Anushree has to write more as it is a topic in itself. You will use paraphrasing tools so it won't be that difficult. (quilt bot)

5. I will add code samples to these topics you will cover. And, I will update the ER Diagrams and DF Diagram as nothing went as planned. So don't hate me for simply sitting and instructing.

And yeah, I have to give a code walk-through. Decide mutually and let me know about it.
